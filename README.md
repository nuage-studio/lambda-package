This repository provides both a library function and command-line tool to package up Lambda functions.
Given a directory, it will package all the files in the directory into a zip file, but ignoring any files
covered exclude patterns.  If exclude patterns are not given in the configuation, then these patterns
will be read from the `.gitignore` file.

## Command line useage

To use on the command line, you should install the package using pip, and then use the following command:

```
python -m lambda_package path [--output OUTPUT]
```

where `path` is the path to the source directory which you wish to package, and the
`--output` (or `-o`) option specifies the zip file output.  If no `-o` option is given,
the tool will display a preview of the file tree which it would package.


## Library usage

The package also exposes a function named `package`, which performs the same function
as the command line.  For example:

```python
from lambda_package import package

package(root_path="src", Configuration(output="app.zip"))
```

## Configuration

Further configuration can be specified in either the `.lambda-packagerc` or `setup.cfg`
files, with the former taking priority.  The `package` function will look for these
files by default if no `Configuration` object is passed in.

An example `.lambda-packagerc` might be:

```toml
[lambda-package]
output = "app.zip"
exclude = ["node_modules", "*.bak"]
```

Note that the `exclude` option overrides any patterns in the `.gitignore` file.

| Name             | Default | Description                                                                           |
|------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `output`         | `None`  | The path of the zip file to be generated                                              |
| `exclude`        | `None`  | A list of exclude pattern strings.  If not given, `.gitignore` is used instead.       |
| `requirements`   | `None`  | The path to the requirements.txt file if Python dependencies are to be packaged.      |
| `layer_output`   | `None`  | Path to a folder where requirement outputs should be stored rather than the package.  |
| `use_docker`     | `True`  | Whether or not the Lambda layer dependencies should be built using a Docker image.    |
| `python_version` | _Runtime version_  | The Python version used to build the pip requirements.  Must be in the format `[major].[minor]`, patch version will be ignored. |

## Pip Dependencies

The tool also has the option to automatically bundle any pip dependencies into the
package by setting the `requirements` parameter to be the path to a `requirements.txt`
file.  If `use_docker` is `True`, these requirements will be built using a Docker image
which mimics the Lambda environment.  The `layer_output` option can also be set in order
to package the dependencies into a separate zip file, for the creation of a Lambda layer.

# Development

## Getting started

You need Python 3 (preferably 3.8) installed to start working on this project.

In order to install your virtualenv, just go to the root of the project and:
```bash
make install
```

## IDE

Nuage recommends [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to work on this project, and some default settings have been configured in the [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json).

These settings merely enforce the code-quality guidelines defined below, but if you use another IDE it's probably worth taking a quick look at it to ensure compliance with the standard.

By default, we recommend:
1. Putting your virtualenv in a `venv` folder at the project root
2. Using a `.env` file to define your environment variables (cf. [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/))

## Code quality

This project has opinionated code-quality requirements:
- Code formatter: [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Code linter: [pylint](https://www.pylint.org)
- Code style guidelines: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

All of these tools are enforced at the commit-level via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)

You can run the following command to apply code-quality to your project at any point:
```bash
make quality
```

Code quality configuration files:
- IDE-agnostic coding style settings are set in the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file
- Python-related settings are set in the [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) file
- Pre-commit-related settings are set in the [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file

## Unit tests

* To run the unit tests (you may also want to instantiate a virtual environment in the root directory):

```
python setup.py test
```

The test file names are in the format `{source file name}_tests.py`, or
`{source file name}_{function name}_tests.py` for functions which have a large number of tests.
